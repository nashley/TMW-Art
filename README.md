# TMW-Art
My awful attempts at creating and modifying pixel art
###What Needs to be Done
1. Cut down on the number of types of wood (i.e., cold/snow, wet, dry, weathered, and stained); see http://imgur.com/a/LqDe5#0 for WIP
Refer to the [main todo list](https://gist.github.com/nashley/0e33e0251a312ef430dc) for other art-related items
